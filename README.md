# EMG_armband
EMG armband worn as a bracelet, to detect hand movements and orientation via muscle impulses transmitted through your forearm. One will be designing PCBs based on EMG sensors, integrating them with microcontrollers, and subsequently train the system using Machine Learning (ML).

## Domains Explored

Embedded Systems, IoT, PCB Designing, ML

## Project Workflow

- Learn how to initialize ADC and read digital output readings of Analog sensor
- Study ESP_NOW Communication protocol and send message from one ESP to other ESP
- Learn to design Flex PCB
- Study EMG (Electromyography) Sensors and try to integrate it with microcontrollers (ESP32)


## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
To download and use this code, the minimum requirements are:

- [ESP_IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)
- Windows 7 or later (64-bit), Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any other IDE

### Installation
