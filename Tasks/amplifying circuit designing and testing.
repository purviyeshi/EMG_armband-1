why we need an amplifing circuit ?
EMG signals are weak, low-amplitude electrical signals produced by muscle contractions.
Amplification increases signal strength, reduces noise, enhances sensitivity, and allows for precise data analysis.
This is critical for applications like monitoring muscle activity, and ensuring high-quality, reliable EMG data.
NOTE:
In the EMG signal acquisition system, we utilize five electrodes, with each amplifying module being dedicated to one specific electrode.
Therefore, we require a total of five amplifying modules, each serving as an interface for an individual electrode.
This setup allows us to amplify and process the signals from all five electrodes independently and enhances the accuracy and specificity of our EMG data collection.

In our EMG signal acquisition setup, we combine one amplification PCB with the ESP-32 microcontroller within a single module.
Consequently, we have a total of five separate modules, with one of them featuring the integrated amplification circuit alongside the ESP-32.
The remaining four modules are dedicated to individual electrodes, allowing for efficient signal processing.

AFTER AMPLFYING THE REQUIRED EMG SIGNALS WE HAVE MINIMIZE THE NOISE SIGNALS FOR THAT:
APPLY THE BANDPASS FILTER OF 4TH ORDER:

Bandpass filter
A bandpass filter for EMG signal acquisition is an electronic circuit designed to isolate and emphasize a specific frequency range within the EMG signal.
It helps reduce noise, isolate muscle activity-related frequencies, and improve the quality and specificity of the acquired EMG data.
By tailoring the lower and upper cutoff frequencies, the bandpass filter can be customized to match the frequency characteristics of the EMG signal,
making it a crucial component in medical, research, and clinical applications for accurate and meaningful analysis of muscle activity.
