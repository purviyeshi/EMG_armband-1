Task 1:

# Write a code to get the line sensor readings (Wall-E LSA) without using "sraboard.h" header file.

Here's an explanation of the task:

1. You configure the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) settings. You set the ADC width to 12 bits, which means the ADC will provide values from 0 to 4095.

2. You configure the attenuation for each of the five ADC channels. The attenuation setting `ADC_ATTEN_DB_11` reduces the input voltage range to 0-3.9V, suitable for most applications.

3. You initialize an array `adc1_readings` to store the ADC readings for each sensor. There are five sensors, so the array has a size of 5.

4. You define an array `sensor_channels` to specify the ADC channels to be read.

5. Inside the `while` loop, you read the raw ADC values for each sensor using a for loop. The `adc1_get_raw` function reads the value from the specified channel and stores it in the `adc1_readings` array.

6. You log the raw ADC readings using the ESP_LOGI function. It displays the values for all five sensors.

7. You introduce a small delay using `vTaskDelay` to control the frequency at which sensor readings are taken.

This code repeatedly reads the raw sensor values from the LSA and displays them, allowing you to monitor the sensor data from Wall-E's Line Sensor Array.
