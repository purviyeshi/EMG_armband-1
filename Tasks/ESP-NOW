TASK 2 
Now to establish connection between ESPs, you'll be starting with ESP-NOW protocol 
API Ref: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.3/esp32/api-reference/network/index.html

i)  Establishing a connection between two ESPs 
ii) Exchanging the data between the two ESPs: WE'll be exchanging the LSA values WE recorded in task 1
 we are establishing a connection between two ESP devices using the ESP-NOW protocol and exchanging data between them. Here's an explanation of the task:

Transmitter Side (ESP1):

The transmitter side code initializes the ESP-NOW protocol. It configures the ESP-NOW callback function OnDataSent to handle the status of sent messages.

It sets up WiFi and ESP-NOW on this ESP device.

The LSA (Line Sensor Array) values are read from the ADC channels, and the data is formatted as a string.

The formatted LSA data is sent to the receiver ESP using esp_now_send.

Receiver Side (ESP2):

The receiver side code also initializes the ESP-NOW protocol. It registers a callback function ondatareceived to handle received data.

It sets up WiFi and ESP-NOW on this ESP device.

It adds the transmitter ESP as a peer by specifying its MAC address and channel. This allows the receiver to receive data from the transmitter.

The receiver waits for incoming data in the ondatareceived callback, which logs the received data.

Task 2 Explanation:

Task 2 involves the establishment of a communication link between two ESP devices. ESP1, acting as the transmitter, reads LSA data and sends it to ESP2,acting as the receiver.
The transmitter prepares the LSA data, sends it using ESP-NOW, and the receiver receives and logs the data.
This setup allows you to wirelessly exchange data between the ESP devices, making it possible to share LSA values or other information in real-time or as needed.
